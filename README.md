HR Data Analysis Using Seaborn:.

Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to efficiently draw insights from HR data by plotting different types of graphs and charts.

Dataset:.

Source: HR Data for an MNC (employee details including department, salary, performance, and work mode).

This project analyzes employee data to identify workforce distribution, salary structures, performance trends, and anomalies that may indicate potential fraud or irregularities.

Setup:.

Place the dataset file (hr_data_mnc.csv) in the project root folder.

Install required libraries:.

pip install -r requirements.txt


(requirements.txt should include pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy)

Run the notebook:.

Open HR_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Execute all cells to generate the visualizations.

Outputs

Figures: outputs/figures/*.png (10 visualization plots)

Jupyter Notebook: HR_Analysis.ipynb (with all code)

Dataset: hr_data_mnc.csv

Visualizations:.
1. Number of Employees by Department

Summary: Most employees earn between 5â€“10 LPA. Outliers above 20 LPA may need verification.

Summary: Shows workforce distribution across locations. Some locations have very few employees, which can be flagged as anomalies.

4. Employee performance ratings

Summary: Most of the employees have the ratings as 1 while 80 to 85 have the 5 ratings.

5. Average Salary by Department
   <img width="1000" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67a20712-4252-4b51-b376-2fcb02a4c637" />



Summary: IT nand Finance stand among the highest salary holders while Marketing,HR,Sales have the almost same salary with R&D as the lowest 

6. Salary Distribution by performance rating
   <img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42a65dad-83d4-4ce3-9196-312efdae0e14" />



Summary: Higher performers generally earn more. However, some low-rated employees with very high salaries may be suspicious.

7. Experience vs Salary (by Department)
   <img width="1000" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e27297de-bf2d-40e1-9ad0-b4e1ff6cb840" />



Summary: IT employees hold the position of highest earners followed by finance followed by sales , rest have the same level of salary while r&d as lowest 

8. Salary Distribution across Work Modes
   <img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f80ee794-f9c9-4106-bf53-c0a70eea6b6d" />



Summary: Onsite employees tend to earn slightly more than remote/hybrid. Sharp salary differences may indicate irregularities.

9. Performance Ratings across Departments
    <img width="1200" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba7bec3b-a2d8-4f38-8016-9947ef91df11" />

Summary: Strong positive correlation between salary and experience. Weak correlation with performance rating suggests pay may not always reflect performance.
